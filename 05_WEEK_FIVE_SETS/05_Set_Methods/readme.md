# Challenge 5: Set Methods

## Concept
Learn to use common set methods such as `.copy()`, `.pop()`, and `.clear()` to manipulate sets in Python.

## Objective
Demonstrate the usage of various built-in set methods.

## Task
- Create a set: `data = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}`
- Copy the set using `.copy()` and print it.
- Use `.pop()` to remove a random element and print the updated set.
- Use `.clear()` to empty the set and print the final result.

## Example Output
```python
Copy: {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}
After pop: {20, 30, 40, 50}
After clear: set()
