# Challenge 2: Accessing Set Elements

## Concept
Sets in Python are unordered and unindexed collections. You cannot access items by position, but you can iterate through them.

## Objective
Use a loop to print each element from a set.

## Task
- Create a set `colors = {'red', 'blue', 'green', 'yellow'}`.
- Use a `for` loop to print each color.

## Example Output
```python
red
blue
green
yellow
