# Challenge 4: Set Operations

## Concept
Sets in Python allow you to perform mathematical set operations such as **union**, **intersection**, and **difference**.

## Objective
Combine and compare two sets using basic set operations.

## Task
- Create two sets:  
  `set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}`  
  `set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}`  
- Print:
  - The union of the sets
  - The intersection of the sets
  - The difference (`set1 - set2`)

## Example Output
```python
Union: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
Intersection: {3, 4}
Difference: {1, 2}
