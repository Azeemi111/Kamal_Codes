# Challenge 7: Sets vs Lists

## Concept
Learn the key differences between sets and lists in Python, particularly how sets automatically remove duplicates, while lists can have repeated elements.

## Objective
Compare the behavior of sets and lists by converting a list to a set and observing the difference.

## Task
- Create a list: `num_list = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]`
- Convert the list into a set and print both the list and the set.

## Example Output
```python
List: [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]
Set: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
